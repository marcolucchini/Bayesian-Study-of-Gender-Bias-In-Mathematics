<h3 align="left">Description:</h3>
<p align="left">The work aims to study the gender bias in the results obtained in mathematics competence as compared to linguistic and humanistic competencies in Catalonia, Spain. The Department of Education of the Generalitat de Cataluña conducts a test of basic competencies and knowledge in linguistic, mathematical, and scientific-technological areas in the last years of primary and secondary education. The focus of this work is to determine if the scores obtained by the students of Catalonia in the different tests depend on variables such as gender, location, or type of school attended. The primary objective is to examine if there is a gender bias in the results obtained in mathematical competence. A model will be created to relate the score obtained in mathematical competence to gender, linguistic competencies, and type of educational center or population size. The first objective is to verify if the stereotype of "girls are more into literature and not science" is true. The second objective is to study if the results are maintained for both genders, or if there are significant differences between the two.</p>
